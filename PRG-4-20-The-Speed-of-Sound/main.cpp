//  The following table shows the approximate speed of sound in air, water, and steel.
//
//  Medium                      Speed
//  ----------------------------------------------------
//  Air                         1,100 feet per second
//  Water                       4,900 feet per second
//  Steel                       16,400 feet per second
//
//  Write a program that displays a menu allowing the user to select air, water, or steel.
//  After the user has made a selection, he or she should be asked to enter the distance a
//  sound wave will travel in the selected medium. The program will then display the
//  amount of time it will take. (Round the answer to four decimal places.)
//
//  Input Validation: Check that the user has selected one of the available choices from the
//  menu. Do not accept distances less than 0.
